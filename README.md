# 🐱🐶 Cats vs Dogs Classification

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow to classify images of cats and dogs. It leverages an open-source dataset and demonstrates the power of deep learning for image recognition tasks.

## 📌 Overview

- Built a CNN using TensorFlow and Keras
- Trained on the popular Cats vs Dogs dataset
- Included image preprocessing and data augmentation
- Achieved high classification accuracy on unseen test images
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy and loss metrics

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The CNN includes:
- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions
- Dropout layers for regularization
- Dense layers for final classification

## 📊 Results

The model performed well in distinguishing cats from dogs, showing strong generalization on new images after training for multiple epochs with optimized hyperparameters.
